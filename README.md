# First Backend App

This repository contains a basic backend application built using Node.js and Express.js. It serves as an introductory project demonstrating fundamental concepts like setting up a server, handling simple GET requests, and using environment variables.

## Description

This is a beginner-friendly backend application created to learn and practice Node.js and Express.js fundamentals. It sets up a simple HTTP server that responds to a few predefined routes.

## Technology Stack

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Express.js:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* **dotenv:** Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Usually comes bundled with Node.js)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (For cloning the repository)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AadityaSinghWeb2005/first-Backend-App-.git](https://github.com/AadityaSinghWeb2005/first-Backend-App-.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd first-Backend-App-
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit the `.env` file** and set the necessary variables. Currently, the only variable used is:
    * `PORT`: The port number the server will listen on (e.g., `PORT=3000`). If not set, the application defaults to port 3000.

## Running the Application

To start the server, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
npm start
```
Okay, here is a generated README.md file for the repository https://github.com/AadityaSinghWeb2005/first-Backend-App-.

This README includes:

A title and description based on the repository details.
Sections for technology stack, prerequisites, installation, environment variables, running the app, and available endpoints based on the code (index.js) and package.json.
Standard sections like Contributing and License.

# First Backend App

This repository contains a basic backend application built using Node.js and Express.js. It serves as an introductory project demonstrating fundamental concepts like setting up a server, handling simple GET requests, and using environment variables.

## Description

This is a beginner-friendly backend application created to learn and practice Node.js and Express.js fundamentals. It sets up a simple HTTP server that responds to a few predefined routes.

## Technology Stack

* **dotenv:** Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Usually comes bundled with Node.js)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (For cloning the repository)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AadityaSinghWeb2005/first-Backend-App-.git](https://github.com/AadityaSinghWeb2005/first-Backend-App-.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd first-Backend-App-
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit the `.env` file** and set the necessary variables. Currently, the only variable used is:
    * `PORT`: The port number the server will listen on (e.g., `PORT=3000`). If not set, the application defaults to port 3000.

## Running the Application

To start the server, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
npm start
```
This will execute the `node index.js` command defined in `package.json.`

You should see output similar to this in your terminal:
```
Example app listening on port 3000
```
(The port number may differ based on your `.env` configuration).

The application will then be accessible at `http://localhost:<PORT>`.

API Endpoints
The application provides the following simple GET endpoints:

* `GET /`
  
  Description: Returns a basic greeting.
  
  Response: `Hello World!`

* `GET /twitter`
  
  Description: Returns a placeholder string.
  
  Response: `hitesh.com`

* `GET /login`
  
  Description: Returns a simple HTML heading.
  
  Response: `<h1>please login at chai aur code</h1>`
  
You can test these endpoints using a web browser or tools like curl or Postman (e.g., curl http://localhost:3000/twitter).
